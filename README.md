## Overview

<IMG SRC="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/cover.png"  align=right hspace=25 width=100 alt = "Algorithms 4/e textbook">

algorithmcpp is a C++ library port of [algs4.jar](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/) with the goal to serve instructors and programmers who adopt the Algorithms, 4th Edition textbook and would prefer to follow and demonstrate the text's algorithms using C++.

## Documentation

The library was delivered as a [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com) solution. It adopts [CRT Library](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/finding-memory-leaks-using-the-crt-library?view=vs-2017) to detect memory leak, and refers to [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) over the naming rules.
